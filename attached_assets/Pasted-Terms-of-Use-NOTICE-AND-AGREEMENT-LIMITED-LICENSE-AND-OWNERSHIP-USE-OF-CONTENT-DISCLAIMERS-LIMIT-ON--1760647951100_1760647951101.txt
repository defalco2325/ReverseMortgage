6. INDEMNITY
If you are a business or organization, to the extent permitted by law, you will indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any costs, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) from third-party claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Sites and Content or any violation of these Terms. You may not settle any such third-party claims without our written consent.

7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
YOU AND LONGBRIDGE AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:

Mandatory Arbitration
You and Longbridge agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Site Terms or our Content, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Site Terms existed (a “Dispute”), through final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the later of (1) Acceptance of the Site Terms or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by sending an email to LBCompliance@longbridge-financial.com or (2) the date you submit an application with Longbridge for a financial product or quote through the Sites calculator feature. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon arbitration terms will apply.

Informal Dispute Resolution
We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending an email to LBCompliance@longbridge-financial.com. We will do so by sending you notice to the email address and/or contact information provided through the Sites. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.

Arbitration Forum
If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available here). Longbridge will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities described in these Site Terms may involve interstate commerce and, to the extent applicable, the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and any arbitration.

Arbitration Procedures
The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference, if possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of Kent County, Delaware have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.

Exceptions
This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Sites and Content or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

Class and Jury Trial Waivers
You and Longbridge agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and Longbridge knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.

Batch Arbitration
If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and Longbridge agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”), unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings.

Severability
If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.

The Sites are not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity, or any jurisdiction or country, where such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation, would subject Longbridge to any liability or would not give effect to all of the provisions in this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing agreement to arbitrate in Section 7 hereof, the state or federal courts sitting in Kent County, Delaware shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any dispute arising out of these Terms, and you hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.

14. USE FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED

15. COMPLETE AGREEMENT; NO REPRESENTATIONS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Longbridge relating to your access to and use of the Sites and other than any service-specific Terms, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Longbridge. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. The provisions of this Agreement, which expressly or by implication are intended to survive its termination, will survive and continue to bind both you and Longbridge.

16. NO WAIVER
A party’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Site Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision and does not waive any right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
